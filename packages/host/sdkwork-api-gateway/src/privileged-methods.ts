/**
 * Methods gated to loopback even on a trusted-host deployment. Native dialogs
 * act on the host machine; the settings and credential domains mutate the
 * user's configuration and secret store, and READING them is equally
 * privileged — `settings.describe` returns every exposed namespace's
 * configuration and `credentials.describe` reports whether an arbitrary
 * environment-variable name is configured and where from, which is
 * reconnaissance no anonymous caller should have. `trustedHosts` is a
 * DNS-rebinding fence, explicitly not authentication, so the whole
 * configuration plane stays loopback-same-origin until a real authentication
 * layer exists. `llm.discoverModels` belongs to that plane on both counts: it
 * carries a draft credential, and it makes the HOST issue a GET to a URL the
 * caller chose and reports back the status or the parsed body — an anonymous
 * LAN caller would have a probe for whatever the host can reach and the
 * browser cannot.
 *
 * The model catalog (`llm.providers`, `llm.models`) is deliberately NOT here:
 * it carries provider ids, display names, and model lists — no endpoints,
 * keys, or key state — and a LAN client's model picker legitimately needs it.

  // A preset composition names the plugins a session runs, so reading one is

  // or a path; the pin is about who may manage the roster at all.)
  //
  // CHOOSING one is not pinned, and `agentPreset.list` is not either. Picking a
  // preset looks like escalation — one of them mounts the toolset that edits the
  // live runtime — but `session.create` already takes an `agentPreset`, so
  // pinning only the switch would leave the same capability one method over.
  // The deeper reason is that the capability is not the preset's to grant: the
  // deployment's own default already carries `bash` and the filesystem tools, so
  // any caller that may start a session at all can already run commands as this
  // process. Pinning the switch would be a fence beside an open gate.
